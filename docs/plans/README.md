# Project Plans

This directory contains all project planning documents for the anon-identity framework. Each plan tracks the implementation progress of specific features or initiatives.

## Plan Structure

Each plan document should include:
- **Overview**: Brief description of the feature/initiative
- **Implementation Status**: Current progress (âœ… COMPLETED, ðŸš§ IN PROGRESS, ðŸ“‹ PLANNED)
- **Phases**: Breakdown of work into manageable phases
- **Progress Updates**: Notes added as each phase is completed
- **Lessons Learned**: Insights gained during implementation

## Current Plans

### Completed Plans
- [Agent Sub-Identity Plan](./AGENT_SUB_IDENTITY_PLAN.md) - âœ… COMPLETED
  - Implemented sub-identities for AI agents with scoped permissions
  - All 5 phases completed successfully

### Active Plans
- [Agent Activity Monitoring](./AGENT_ACTIVITY_MONITORING_PLAN.md) - ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
  - Comprehensive activity logging and audit trail for agents
  - Decentralized storage using IPFS
  - Real-time streaming and compliance features

- [Roadmap Update 2025](./ROADMAP_UPDATE_2025.md) - ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
  - Updated roadmap following agent sub-identity implementation
  - Focuses on agent ecosystem and AI integrations

- [Next Features Priority](./NEXT_FEATURES_PRIORITY.md) - ðŸ“‹ PLANNED
  - Prioritized list of features to implement next
  - Organized by criticality and timeline

## Progress Tracking Convention

When completing parts of a plan:
1. Update the relevant phase/task status
2. Add a timestamp and brief note about what was completed
3. Note any deviations from the original plan
4. Document any lessons learned or insights

Example:
```markdown
### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure âœ… COMPLETED (2024-01-15)
- âœ… Implement agent identity creation
- âœ… Basic delegation credential structure
- âœ… Parent-child DID relationship

**Progress Note (2024-01-15):** Completed ahead of schedule. Added additional
helper functions for backward compatibility that weren't in original plan.
```

## Creating New Plans

When starting a new feature or initiative:
1. Create a new markdown file in this directory
2. Use the naming convention: `FEATURE_NAME_PLAN.md`
3. Include all standard sections (Overview, Phases, etc.)
4. Link it from this README
5. Update status as work progresses
