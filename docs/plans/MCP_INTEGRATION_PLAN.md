# MCP (Model Context Protocol) Integration Plan

## Overview

This plan outlines the integration of Model Context Protocol (MCP) for all LLM communication within the Anonymous Identity Framework's agent-to-agent delegation system. MCP will provide a standardized, secure, and efficient way for agents to communicate with various LLM providers.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing LLM Integration Points
- **Agent Communication**: Direct API calls to LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.)
- **Natural Language Processing**: Ad-hoc integration in delegation examples
- **Function Calling**: Direct OpenAI function calling implementation
- **Decision Making**: Rule-based systems with occasional LLM consultation

### Current Limitations
- ❌ Multiple direct API integrations for different LLM providers
- ❌ Inconsistent error handling across LLM providers
- ❌ No standardized context management
- ❌ Limited observability and monitoring of LLM interactions
- ❌ Security concerns with direct API key management
- ❌ Difficult to switch between LLM providers
- ❌ No unified prompt management system

### Goals for MCP Integration
1. **Standardization**: Unified interface for all LLM communications
2. **Security**: Centralized credential management and secure communication
3. **Observability**: Comprehensive logging and monitoring of LLM interactions
4. **Flexibility**: Easy switching between LLM providers
5. **Reliability**: Robust error handling and retry mechanisms
6. **Context Management**: Efficient context sharing and persistence
7. **Cost Optimization**: Usage tracking and optimization features
