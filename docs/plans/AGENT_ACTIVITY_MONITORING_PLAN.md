## Technical Specifications

### IPFS Configuration
```typescript
const ipfsConfig = {
  repo: 'agent-activity-repo',
  config: {
    Addresses: {
      Swarm: [
        '/dns4/wrtc-star1.par.dwebops.pub/tcp/443/wss/p2p-webrtc-star',
        '/dns4/wrtc-star2.sjc.dwebops.pub/tcp/443/wss/p2p-webrtc-star'
      ]
    },
    Bootstrap: [
      '/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmNnooDu7bfjPFoTZYxMNLWUQJyrVwtbZg5gBMjTezGAJN',
      '/dnsaddr/bootstrap.libp2p.io/p2p/QmQCU2EcMqAqQPR2i9bChDtGNJchTbq5TbXJJ16u19uLTa'
    ]
  }
};
```

### Activity Schema
```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema#",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "id": { "type": "string", "format": "uuid" },
    "agentDID": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^did:" },
    "parentDID": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^did:" },
    "timestamp": { "type": "string", "format": "date-time" },
    "type": { "type": "string", "enum": ["authentication", "authorization", "data_access", "data_modification", "scope_usage", "error", "revocation"] },
    "serviceDID": { "type": "string", "pattern": "^did:" },
    "scopes": { "type": "array", "items": { "type": "string" } },
    "status": { "type": "string", "enum": ["success", "failed", "denied"] },
    "details": { "type": "object" },
    "ipfsHash": { "type": "string" }
  },
  "required": ["id", "agentDID", "parentDID", "timestamp", "type", "serviceDID", "status"]
}
```

## Security Considerations

### Encryption
- All activity data encrypted before IPFS storage
- User controls encryption keys
- Support for key rotation

### Access Control
- Only parent identity can access agent activities
- Service providers cannot read activity logs
- Optional sharing with auditors via delegated access

### Data Integrity
- Merkle tree for activity batches
- Cryptographic signatures on all entries
- Immutable IPFS content addressing

## Privacy Considerations

### Data Minimization
- Store only necessary activity data
- Aggregate old activities into summaries
- Auto-delete detailed logs after retention period

### Selective Disclosure
- Users can share specific activity ranges
- Redact sensitive details when sharing
- Zero-knowledge proofs for compliance

## Integration Points

### With Existing Components
```typescript
// Integration with AgentEnabledServiceProvider
class AgentEnabledServiceProvider {
  private activityLogger: ActivityLogger;
  
  async verifyPresentation(presentation: VerifiablePresentation): Promise<VerificationResult> {
    const result = await super.verifyPresentation(presentation);
    
    // Log the verification attempt
    await this.activityLogger.logActivity({
      type: ActivityType.AUTHENTICATION,
      agentDID: presentation.holder,
      serviceDID: this.serviceManifest.serviceDID,
      status: result.valid ? 'success' : 'failed',
      details: { errors: result.errors }
    });
    
    return result;
  }
}
```

### With User Wallet
```typescript
// Integration with UserWallet
class UserWallet {
  private activityMonitor: ActivityMonitor;
  
  async getAgentActivities(agentDID: string, query?: ActivityQuery): Promise<AgentActivity[]> {
    return this.activityMonitor.queryActivities({ ...query, agentDID });
  }
  
  async subscribeToAgentActivities(agentDID: string, callback: (activity: AgentActivity) => void): Subscription {
    return this.activityMonitor.subscribe(agentDID, callback);
  }
}
```

## Performance Targets

2. **Performance**: Minimal impact on agent operations
3. **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime for activity streaming
4. **Storage Efficiency**: < 1KB per activity entry
5. **User Satisfaction**: Easy to understand activity logs

## Future Enhancements

   - Anomaly detection in agent behavior
   - Predictive analytics for resource usage
   - Automated compliance checking

2. **Advanced Visualizations**
   - Activity heat maps
   - Service interaction graphs
   - Timeline visualizations

3. **Integration Extensions**
   - Blockchain anchoring for critical activities
   - Integration with SIEM systems
   - Webhook notifications for events

## Dependencies

- IPFS/Helia for decentralized storage
- WebSocket library for real-time streaming
- Encryption library (existing crypto module)
- React/Vue for dashboard components
- Chart library for visualizations

## Risk Mitigation

1. **IPFS Availability**: Use multiple IPFS gateways and pinning services
2. **Storage Costs**: Implement activity aggregation and archival
3. **Performance Impact**: Use batching and async logging
4. **Privacy Leaks**: Encrypt all data before storage
5. **Key Management**: Integrate with existing secure storage

## Implementation Summary

This plan provides a comprehensive solution for agent activity monitoring that:

1. **Maintains User Control**: All data is encrypted and stored in a decentralized manner
2. **Ensures Transparency**: Complete audit trail of all agent actions
3. **Enables Compliance**: Export and reporting features for regulatory requirements
4. **Preserves Privacy**: Encryption and selective disclosure capabilities
5. **Scales Efficiently**: Batching, aggregation, and archival strategies

The use of IPFS ensures that activity logs are tamper-proof and permanently available, while encryption maintains privacy. The real-time streaming capabilities provide immediate visibility into agent actions, crucial for building trust in autonomous agent systems.
