# Next Features Priority List

Based on the successful Agent Sub-Identity implementation, here are the recommended next features in priority order:

## ðŸš¨ Critical Priority (Next 3 months)

### 1. Agent Activity Monitoring & Audit Trail
**Why Critical:** Users need visibility into what agents are doing on their behalf
- Real-time activity logs
- Failed attempt tracking  
- Service interaction history
- Exportable audit reports

### 2. LLM Provider Integration
**Why Critical:** Direct integration with AI services is essential for agent utility
- OpenAI, Anthropic, Google API adapters
- Token usage and cost tracking
- Rate limiting per agent
- Prompt injection protection

### 3. Agent-to-Agent Delegation
**Why Critical:** Complex workflows require agent hierarchies
- Sub-agent creation with restricted scopes
- Maximum delegation depth control
- Scope inheritance rules
- Delegation chain verification

## ðŸ”¥ High Priority (3-6 months)

### 4. Agent Templates & Profiles
**Why Important:** Accelerate adoption with pre-configured agents
- Common use case templates (research, shopping, data analysis)
- Industry-specific profiles (healthcare, finance, education)
- Customizable template marketplace
- One-click agent deployment

### 5. Cross-Service Agent Sessions
**Why Important:** Agents need to work across multiple services seamlessly
- Session federation between services
- Single sign-on for agents
- Cross-service scope mapping
- Session state synchronization

### 6. Privacy-Preserving Analytics
**Why Important:** Understand agent usage without compromising privacy
- Differential privacy for usage metrics
- Aggregated performance insights
- Anomaly detection without raw data exposure
- GDPR-compliant analytics

## ðŸ“ˆ Growth Enablers (6-12 months)

### 7. Agent Registry & Discovery
**Why Strategic:** Enable an ecosystem of discoverable agents
- Decentralized agent directory
- Capability-based search
- Reputation and ratings
- Trust network visualization

### 8. Agent Orchestration Framework
**Why Strategic:** Enable complex multi-agent workflows
- Visual workflow designer
- YAML/JSON workflow definitions
- Inter-agent communication protocol
- Failure handling and rollback

### 9. Platform Integrations
**Why Strategic:** Meet developers where they are
- LangChain adapter
- AutoGPT compatibility
- Slack/Discord/Teams bots
- Browser extension framework

## Key Success Factors

### For Immediate Implementation:
1. **Security First**: Every feature must maintain zero-trust security model
2. **Developer Experience**: APIs should be intuitive and well-documented
3. **Performance**: Features must not degrade core performance
4. **Backward Compatibility**: Existing implementations must continue working

### Architecture Principles:
1. **Modularity**: Each feature should be independently usable
2. **Extensibility**: Easy to add new providers/platforms
3. **Privacy by Design**: User data protection in every feature
4. **Decentralization**: Avoid central points of failure

## Quick Wins (Can implement immediately)

1. **Agent Activity Dashboard UI Component**
   - React/Vue components for activity visualization
   - Real-time WebSocket updates
   - Export functionality

2. **OpenAI Function Calling Adapter**
   - Map agent scopes to OpenAI functions
   - Automatic function generation from scopes
   - Token usage tracking

3. **Agent Template Library**
   - 5-10 common agent templates
   - JSON configuration format
   - CLI tool for template deployment

## Recommended Implementation Order

1. **Month 1**: Activity monitoring + Basic LLM integration
2. **Month 2**: Agent-to-agent delegation + Templates
3. **Month 3**: Cross-service sessions + Analytics foundation
4. **Month 4-6**: Registry, orchestration, and platform integrations

This prioritization balances immediate user needs with strategic platform growth, ensuring the framework becomes the standard for secure agent identity management.
