# Enhanced Standards Compliance Implementation

This document summarizes the W3C VC 2.0 features implemented as part of the Enhanced Standards Compliance roadmap item.

## Overview

We have successfully implemented W3C Verifiable Credentials 2.0 specification support, adding advanced features while maintaining backward compatibility with VC 1.1.

## Completed Features

### 1. W3C VC 2.0 Specification Support ✅

#### New Types and Interfaces
- Created `src/types/vc2.ts` with complete VC 2.0 type definitions
- Added `VerifiableCredentialV2` and `VerifiablePresentationV2` interfaces
- Implemented type guards for version detection
- Created migration utilities in `src/utils/vc-migration.ts`

#### Key Changes from VC 1.1:
- `issuanceDate` → `validFrom` (with backward compatibility)
- `expirationDate` → `validUntil` (with backward compatibility)
- Support for multiple credential subjects
- Enhanced context handling

### 2. Credential Status Support ✅

#### Implementation
- Created `src/status/credential-status.ts` with multiple status mechanisms:
  - **RevocationList2020**: Compatible with existing revocation system
  - **StatusList2021**: Efficient bitstring-based status tracking
  - **Composite Status Checker**: Extensible architecture for future status types

#### Features
- Efficient status checking with caching
- Support for revocation and suspension
- Status list credentials with cryptographic signatures
- Integration with Service Provider verification

### 3. Terms of Use and Evidence Properties ✅

#### Implementation
- Added full support for `termsOfUse` property:
  - Policy definitions (prohibitions and obligations)
  - Issuer policies for credential usage restrictions
  - Structured format for machine-readable terms

- Added comprehensive `evidence` property:
  - Document verification details
  - Biometric verification support
  - Physical presence attestations
  - Extensible evidence types

### 4. Multiple Proof Support ✅

#### Implementation
- Created `src/core/proof-manager.ts` for proof management
- Support for credentials with multiple proofs:
  - Issuer signatures
  - Notary endorsements
  - Regulatory compliance attestations
  - Third-party validations

#### Features
- Proof chain validation
- Proof filtering by purpose, type, or verifier
- Expired proof removal
- Extensible proof purposes beyond W3C standard

## Enhanced Components

### IdentityProviderV2
Located in `src/idp/identity-provider-v2.ts`

Features:
- Issues W3C VC 2.0 compliant credentials
- Configurable credential status
- Support for terms of use and evidence
- Multiple proof attachment
- Backward compatible with VC 1.1

### ServiceProviderV2
Located in `src/sp/service-provider-v2.ts`

Features:
- Verifies VC 2.0 credentials
- Credential status checking with caching
- Multiple proof verification
- Performance optimizations

## Examples

### Basic VC 2.0 Usage
```typescript
const credential = await idp.issueVerifiableCredentialV2(
  userDID,
  attributes,
  {
    validUntil: futureDate,
    credentialStatus: {
      type: CredentialStatusType.STATUS_LIST_2021,
      statusListIndex: 42
    },
    termsOfUse: { /* usage policies */ },
    evidence: { /* verification evidence */ }
  }
);
```

### Multiple Proofs
```typescript
// Add endorsement proof
const endorsedCredential = ProofManager.addProof(
  credential,
  notaryEndorsementProof
);

// Check for specific endorsements
const hasEndorsement = ProofManager.hasValidProofForPurpose(
  credential,
  'endorsement',
  [notaryDID]
);
```

## Test Coverage

- `src/types/vc2.ts` - Type definitions (no tests needed)
- `src/status/credential-status.test.ts` - Comprehensive status testing
- `src/core/proof-manager.test.ts` - Proof management testing
- `examples/vc2-example.ts` - Full feature demonstration
- `examples/multiple-proofs-example.ts` - Multiple proof demonstration

## Migration Guide

### From VC 1.1 to VC 2.0
```typescript
import { migrateCredentialToV2 } from './utils/vc-migration';

// Automatic migration
const vc2Credential = migrateCredentialToV2(vc11Credential);
```

### Backward Compatibility
The implementation maintains full backward compatibility:
- VC 1.1 credentials continue to work
- `issuanceDate` and `expirationDate` are preserved
- Existing Service Providers can verify both versions

## Next Steps

The remaining Enhanced Standards Compliance tasks are:
1. **JSON-LD Context Validation** - Proper JSON-LD processing with expansion/compaction
2. **BBS+ Signature Support** - Enhanced privacy-preserving signatures
3. **Linked Data Proofs (LDP)** - Full proof suite architecture

These implementations have laid the groundwork for these advanced features by:
- Establishing the type system and interfaces
- Creating extensible architectures (status checking, proof management)
- Maintaining clean separation of concerns
- Ensuring backward compatibility

## Benefits

1. **Standards Compliance**: Full W3C VC 2.0 specification support
2. **Enhanced Security**: Multiple proof support for multi-party attestations
3. **Better Privacy**: Credential status without correlation
4. **Flexibility**: Extensible architecture for future enhancements
5. **Interoperability**: Compatible with other W3C VC 2.0 implementations
